### Hi, I’m Coby Chapple.

I believe:

- Collaboration is powerful
- Building software is inherently creative
- Products should help people connect

I care about:

- Building focused products
- Designing approachable interfaces
- Structuring information to encourage flow

I’m focused on making GitHub the most insanely useful developer tool on the planet. I’m learning a lot about technology, design, and working remotely along the way.
