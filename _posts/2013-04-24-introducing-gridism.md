# Introducing Gridism

When I design web layouts, my thought process usually goes something like this:

> Alright, in this section, I want a bit that’s one third of the section’s
> width, and then next to that I want another bit that’s two thirds of the
> sections’s width. Now, in the next section…

I don’t think in 12 or 16 column grids. Instead, my mental model basically just
consists of the page being divided up into multiple full-width vertical
sections, and each vertical section being divided up into simple fractions of
the section width.
