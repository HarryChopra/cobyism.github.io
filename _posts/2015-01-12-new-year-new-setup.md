title: New year, new setup

As a remote employee, having a home office setup that helps you stay happy and productive is essential. With the start of the new year, I decided to take the opportunity to give my home office workspace a long-overdue overhaul.

I say long-overdue, because for the last year or so my fiancé and I have been focused on doing fairly substantial renovations to our house. We completely [replaced the kitchen](http://instagram.com/p/mFevWHCuJu/), [lounge](http://instagram.com/p/kceDzZCuLG/), and bathroom, as well as replacing all the carpets and repainting the entire house (and I’m not even going to mention all the work we’ve had to do *outside*), so with all that commotion I never got around to setting up my office as I wanted.

That work is pretty much all complete now though, so just before the end of last year, I decided it was time for that to change.

## Desk

I’ve been wanting to switch to a sit-stand desk for a long time, however nothing really stuck out to me as an obvious option. I had [read all the reviews](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-standing-desks/), [watched](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2036834894/the-most-affordable-automatic-sit-to-stand-desk) [all](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/davidyamnitsky/press-fit-standing-desk-affordable-portable-made-i) [kinds](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1875488582/standstand) [of](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1896946361/refold-portable-cardboard-standing-desk) [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/163189569/imovr-omega-nextgen-standing-desk-and-treadmill-de) [campaigns](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/889675794/storkstand-the-most-affordable-mobile-standing-des) [come](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sccarmichael/the-upstanding-desk) [and](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/501918253/zestdesk-the-worlds-1st-portable-adjustable-standi) [go](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/202275375/readydesk-ultra-affordable-dual-adjustable-standin), and done the obligatory [make-shift standing desk](http://instagram.com/p/vlSnb0CuHq/) thing around the house.

Of the options I considered really viable as a permanent solution, very few of them were available in the UK, and even if they were, almost all the suppliers are focused on corporate customers. They don’t exactly make it easy for individuals to purchase a sit-stand desk online. Of those that do make it easy, the prices were just crazy, and I figured that it wouldn’t be long before someone realised there was a gap in the market for an affordable, easy-to-buy sit-stand desk.

Turns out, I was right to wait.[^1]

Towards the end of 2014, IKEA announced a new office furniture range called Bekant, which includes a sit-stand desk available in a variety of shapes and configurations. At less than £500, this desk was far more affordable than just about anything else on the market. Being able drive down to my local IKEA store and pick one up also meant that I didn’t have to worry about international shipping or any of that malarkey. This was just what I was after, so a few days later, I went into Belfast and bought one.

### A week with the Bekant sit-stand desk

After a little more than a week working at this desk, I love it. The build quality feels great, and I’m not missing the more advanced features of other desks on the market like height preset controls, keyboard trays, and so forth. I actually enjoy tweaking the height of the desk in both the standing and sitting positions (not just switching between them) depending on how I’m feeling throughout the day, so I’m not sure a desk with presets would even be that useful to me.

## Anti-fatigue mat

From the research I’d done on standing-desks, I also wanted to get myself an anti-fatigue mat so that I could stand for even longer chunks of the day, especially while my body was first getting used to working in a standing much more than it has in a long time. Once I had the desk, I decided to try [one of the cheaper mats available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00BBU4JX2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00), sceptical I was skeptical that spending three or four times that on [other mats](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-standing-desk-mat/).

While I haven’t got anything to compare it to, the mat I went feels pretty damn good. It’s really comfortable to stand on (both with shoes and without), and it doesn’t move around too much. I’m sure there are probably better ones out there, but for the price, I figure this is a good [80/20 solution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).

## Chair

When I first moved to the UK, I bought a second-hand Humanscale Freedom chair. It’s been okay, however it never really gave me the feeling that it was that much better than other more standard office chairs. Sure, it had some nice adjustments, but the recline action in it just didn’t seem to give me the support I felt I wanted (especially in the lower back).

On a recent trip to GitHub HQ in SF, I took the opportunity to try sitting in a few different chairs for a couple of days of work each, since there are a few different brands and models floating around the office. I’d often sat in Aeron’s before, but one chair I tried also stuck out to me as a really good fit: the Steelcase Leap, (which I also saw had a pretty stellar [write-up on The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-office-chair-is-the-steelcase-leap/)).

The Leap gave me plenty of lower-back/lumbar support, and the highly-adjustable armrests (especially the the ability to angle them inwards) was something I didn’t even realise I wanted until I tried it out. So, I checked out the options and ordered a second-hand Leap from eBay. It arrived a few days ago, however there was an issue with the lift/height adjustment, which I’m working to resolve with the eBay seller at the moment. Because I haven’t been able to adjust the chair to a height that suits me though, it’s been hard to use the chair much yet. I’ll probably have more to report in a few weeks, but I’m pretty certain I’m going to be really happy with this chair.
