title: Open Source needs a new UI

As a freelance web developer, I’ve seen
and used my fair share of open source web applications (and desktop
software), and I’d like to point out something that I see all too often
in open source projects: the user interface almost always lets the
project down. Let me explain…

## The Problem

I’ve used a considerable amount of open source software (web-based
and desktop), and I feel that a large portion of them are let down by
their UI. The functionality is brilliant, the code is great, and the
product is useful, but the user interface often just lacks the
smoothness and level of polish that people tend to expect these days if
they’re to download an application and give it a fair go.

### First Impressions

Most of the time, it’s not even the software itself, but rather the
promotional site—the face of the project—that makes me cringe. For
example, as I explore the web, I come across sites for open source
projects on a daily basis — recent examples from my browsing history
include [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/), [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/), [GnuCash](http://www.gnucash.org/), [BambooInvoice](http://bambooinvoice.org/), [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/), and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
 — and while the promotional sites convey all the necessary information,
 most of these sites look stuck in a much older paradigm of thinking
about web design. It’s not just a handful of projects, though—I actually
 think it is by far the rule rather than the exception with open source
projects in general. Surely it’s not the best first impression to be
making about your software.

### The Products Themselves

It’s not just the promotional websites though—if you look at the
actual software products themselves in many open source projects and
compare them with the commercial applications they’re essentially
competing with, it’s usually the UI that is the separating factor. Take [ProjectPier](http://www.projectpier.org/) for example: it’s functionality is significantly similar to that of commercial projects like [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/) and [activeCollab](http://www.activecollab.com/)
 (which is actually a direct descendent/fork of ProjectPier that went
commercial, by the way), however ProjectPier’s UI feels miles behind to
me. Despite moving to a new theme in their more recent releases, the
default UI (and most other themes available too) is still reminiscent of
 websites that were all the craze before YouTube was around. It’s a
similar situation when you look at projects like [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.ch/) and [Filezilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) compared with commercial FTP applications like [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/) and [Forklift](http://www.binarynights.com/); or for Git GUI apps [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/) compared with apps like [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) and [Gitbox](http://gitboxapp.com/);
 and I could think of numerous other examples in just about every other
problem domain too. What it boils down to is this: as a consumer of
software, it’s the quality of the UI that sways my decision in almost
every case.

## Getting it right

There are, however, plenty of great examples in the open source world
 of good UI design in terms of both promotional sites and software
products. Here are a few examples (not an exhaustive list though, by any
 means) of projects I think are getting it right:

- [Locomotive CMS](http://www.locomotivecms.com/)
- [Fork CMS](http://www.fork-cms.com/)
- [Pow](http://pow.cx/)
- [Octopress](http://octopress.org/)
- [Spree](http://spreecommerce.com/)
- [jQTouch](http://jqtouch.com/)
- [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/)
- [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/)
- [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/)
- [Magento](http://www.magentocommerce.com/)
- [Symphony](http://symphony-cms.com/)

There’s also a few community projects to do with the open source
community in general, which are placing a focus on the UI of open source
 in general. The most readily available example of this is [MoveTheWebForward.org](http://movethewebforward.org/) which aim to make it easier for people to <em>get themselves</em>
 involved in the open source community. Sites like this are fantastic,
but I don’t think it’s just the web that needs to be brought forward—I
think it’s the UI of many aspects of open source software too.

## Maybe this is just a rant

Who knows? Maybe I’m just being an elitist snob because I’m a
designer for a living myself—but I wonder what effect a focus on
improving the UI of open source software would have on the rate of
uptake of open source software projects, especially by users who are
less technically minded (and thus more interested in the elegance of the
 UI than the elegance of the code). Is there a preconceived notion held
by the open-source community that paying attetion to design (especially
of the promotional websites for projects) is superfluous? Or is it just a
 shortage of time, effort, and contributors? Do we need to get more
designers involved in open source to balance out the focus on
development?

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this topic, so if you’ve got an opinion
about what I’ve said, [let me know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.author.handle }}).

### Disclaimer

If you happen to be involved with one of the project’s I’ve used
above as an example, then I apologise—open source software has made my
life a great deal easier, and for that I’ll always be grateful. My
intention is not to offend, or to belittle the valuable contributions
people have made to the projects mentioned above, however I stand by my
point that open source UI in general has a long way to go to catch up to
 its commercial counterparts.
