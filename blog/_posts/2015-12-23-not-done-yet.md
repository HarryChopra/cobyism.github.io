My [28th birthday](/blog/donating-my-birthday) has now been and gone, and thanks to all of you wonderful people you’ve helped me [raise over US$900 for **charity: water**](https://my.charitywater.org/cobyism/cobys-28th-birthday). What an incredible birthday present! I’m humbled, and I want to extend my sincere gratitude to everyone who has donated so far. Because of you, **30 people** will get access to clean water, and their lives will be *permanently* changed in a multitude of ways as a result. Thank you.

… but we’re not done yet.

My birthday may be over, but there’s still *far* too many people in the world who don’t have access to life’s most basic need: clean water. The good news is there’s still time to join in. My campaign will stay open for donations until December 31st—just enough time for any of you who haven’t (yet) had the pleasure of donating to jump on board and help change the lives of a even more people.

## My challenge to you

Donating the age I just turned in dollars (US$28) is enough to permanently give a person access to a clean water project somewhere else in the world. Chances are that’s not an amount that will make a massive dent in your week, but to someone elsewhere in the world, it means a **permanent change** in their quality of life.

It’s christmas, after all—and most of us already have everything we need. Why not change someone else’s life for good this year?

I hereby invite you to:

1. [Go to my campaign’s page](https://my.charitywater.org/cobyism/cobys-28th-birthday)
2. Choose an amount. I suggest my age in dollars (US$28), but it’s up to you. What about donating an amount matching *your* age?
3. Hit the button.

You’ll feel great all week, I promise. :yum:
