title: Take the power back
---


Wherever you are in life, take responsibility for being there. Everyone's situation is unique, with their own set of setbacks in the rear view mirror, and their own set of challenges in front of them, but what unifies us all is the reality that nobody but ourselves can step up and take responsibility for the direction our life takes.

Friends will support you, mentors will guide you, family will love you—but only you are in a position to *own* your life.

Until you acknowledge this, you will remain powerless. If you're sitting around on your couch hoping that somebody else is going to step up, or that the tide of the universe will change and start to carry you to the top, then you're giving your power away.

Once you do acknowledge your responsibility though, things change. In the wise words of Rage Against the Machine, you've got to **take the power back**. Change your worldview so that the power over your fate lies *within* (I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true), instead of being something external. Take responsibility for getting yourself in shape, for improving your ability to manage your finances, for nurturing your friendships so they don't go stale, for progressing in your career or business, and for any other area of your life that could do with some love. Would you rather leaves all these things up to chance? I think not.

But how?

- **Orientate**. Take stock. Be honest with yourself about where you are, and how you feel about being there. Consider the *trajectory* you're on, and where you might end up if things continue as they are.

- **Set goals**. Make time to set goals for yourself, if you don't already have them. List out the significant areas of your life and fast forward a year, five years, and ten years. Where *could* you be? Where do you *want* to be?

- **Plan** a path that you think has a reasonable chance of taking you from where you are to where you want to go. I like to *work backwards* from,y goals. For example, "In order for this to happen, what *else* needs to be true first?"

- **Discipline** yourself to take the [daily actions](http://cobyism.com/blog/its-easy) necessary to keep you on track.

- **Be patient** with yourself. Meaningful change won't happen instantly, so don't beat yourself up. You have to persist, despite not seeing results right away.

Or… do something different. Approach it another way if you want, but *do something*. This is how I've been approaching things, and it might not work for you. Heck, it might not work for me *either*, but if that turns out to be the case the I'll change tack and try something new *until* I get where I want. That "until" is key. Do whatever **you** need *until* you achieve your ambitions.

Remember, you're responsible for your own life, whether you're conscious of it or not. Better make the most of it! :smiley:
