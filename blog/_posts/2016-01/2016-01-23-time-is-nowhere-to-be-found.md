Whether it’s things we want to do, or things we *must* do, it’s always hard to *find time* to fit it all into the day. What I’ve discovered in the years since I first heard this dialogue from The Matrix Reloaded is that time is very very rarely something that is just *found*. We don’t just stumble upon a chunk of time in the middle of our day, in the same way we might discover a stray coin in the bottom of our pocket we’d forgotten about.

Even on the rare occasions that we *do* unexpectedly find ourselves with a spare hour in the day, it usually makes much more sense to make the most of the downtime in-between other things. We **take** a moment to breathe, to clear our heads. It’s rare we get a respite like that, so we *take it for ourselves*.

In fact, that’s **exactly** what we should be doing more often. We don’t have to wait until we have an unspoken-for block of time to take part of it for something we value. Turns out that even when time is spoken for, we can still take some of it for a different purpose and usually we find a way to still meet all our commitments.

Sure, we could just *hope* that the things we want our life to consist of will find their way into our lives, but I’d rather not chance it. I’d rather *take time* every single day for the things that are important to me. That way, even if I lose control of the *direction* of my life, I know for sure that life will be made of what I want along the way.

When was the last time you *took time* for something you value?
