Late last year, I applied for [Seth Godin](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/)’s [altMBA](http://altmba.com/) intensive, and I was fortunate enough to be one of the 100 people to be accepted for this third iteration.

It starts this week. Yesterday, the first projects (of thirteen total over the 4 weeks!) were released, and it’s a significant understatement to say this month is going to be **a doozy**. If I’m honest about what it feels like to be staring down the barrel of this month, I feel anxious, overwhelmed, curious, excited, and oddly skeptical. It’s an odd mix, but there you have it.

In the spirit of [letting go of the brakes](http://cobyism.com/blog/letting-go-of-the-brakes/), I’m doing everything I can to lean forwards instead of backing off, and it’s going to be incredibly interesting to see what happens. The altMBA is all about [change](http://info.altmba.com/), and I *know* I’m going to change as a result.

I just *don’t know how*. Here’s to the unknown! :sweat_smile: :beers: :tada:
