title: Create drivers, not cars

When [Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford) created the [Ford Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T) in 1908—the first affordable automobile, and the catalyst for the entire automotive industry as we know it today—it wasn’t about the car.

Yes, the product was novel. Yes, it was affordable. Yes, it was shiny and black, but all of that is besides the point, and here’s why.

Henry Ford wasn’t creating cars, he was creating *drivers*.

Before 1900, people weren’t drivers. Nobody had driver’s licenses. Sure, some people "drove" a horse and cart, but the idea of someone being a "driver" as we know it today simply didn’t exist.

The Model T was just a means to an end. It’s job was to enable people to become a "driver", and in giving people this new superpower, it *transformed* them.

What does your product transform people into?
