Now that my [altMBA](http://altmba.com/) experience is over (I’ll be writing more about that soon), I’m going to be taking some time to reassess where I’m focusing with this blog and my other non-GitHub-work projects. To help me work out what’s next, I need *your help*. Yes, you.

Your mission today, if you’re reading this, is to send me a five sentence email. **Today.** Yes, you heard me correctly—I actually want to receive *more email*. Crazy right? Perhaps, but I want to hear from you, and other people like you, because I want to learn how I can more effectively contribute to **your life**.

Set aside **2.7 minutes**, and write down a short answer for each of the following questions:

1. **Who are you?** I want to know who you are, and maybe something else about you like where you’re from, or where you live now. Example: *"My name is … and I’m from …"*

2. **What do you do?** Tell me what is it you do for work, what side-project your working on, or what your forte, passion, or focus is in life. Example: *"I work as a … but in my spare time I’m also working on …"*

3. **How did you find out about me?** I want to know how you came across me and my work. Example: "I first found out about you by …"

4. **What value do you get from me?** Tell me, if you can, what aspect of my work gives you something worthwhile. Example: *"What I value about your work is …"*

5. **What are you struggling with right now?** Tell me about *that thing* you’re currently wrestling with in your mind. I know you’re churning away on something, and I’d love to see if I can help you find a way forward. Example: *"At the moment, the biggest thing I’m struggling with is …"*

Lastly, address your email to [coby@cobyism.com](mailto:coby@cobyism.com).

I want to level up my ability to help people *just like you* do things that really matter. I want to reach more people, and I want to be a force for positive change in the world. Narrowing that down so a specific area of focus is important, but it’s really tricky, and that’s why I’m asking for your input.

This is an experiment. *It might not work*. I don’t know exactly what will come out of your email, but I promise that if you take the time to send me an email, I’ll read every word.

So please—help me help you.

**Open up your email now**, type five short sentences, and hit send. Who knows what might happen?
