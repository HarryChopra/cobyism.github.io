title: Our goal’s job

What is a goal *actually for*? First off, a goal is for **getting us moving**. Picking a goal, and making a start in that direction—even if it isn’t the “right” goal (whatever that means)—at least gets us moving forward. We can always adjust our trajectory and rethink our goals after we take flight. That’s allowed.

Secondly, stating a goal forces us to [confront the ambiguity](http://cobyism.com/blog/name-your-ambiguity/) that exists in the gap between our current point A, and our goal’s point B. When we must externally state our aim, it forces us to begin mapping out the potential path, including all of the rocky patches we expect we’ll need to navigate. This lets us focus our energy on the journey instead of *whether to even commit* to the goal or not, and allows the process to begin.

Lastly, a goal serves us at multiple points along the way towards our destination. There will always be surprises, and when we’re staring down the barrel of this latest catastrophe, we need to be able to *return* to our original goal and reassess how to approach the remaining stepping stones.

**Goals are a tool**. They give us leverage over our experience by creating tension between the status quo and a vision of how the future *could be*, and this pressure compels internal and external forces into motion that push us forward.

What is your goal, right now? Is it doing it’s job?
