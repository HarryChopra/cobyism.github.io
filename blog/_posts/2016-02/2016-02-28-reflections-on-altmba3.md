title: Reflections on altMBA³

---

It’s been three weeks now since the third session of Seth Godin’s [altMBA](http://altmba.com/) intensive wrapped up, and I’ve deliberately refrained from writing any more about it (see my earlier reflections on [week 1](http://cobyism.com/blog/altmba-week-1/), [week 2](http://cobyism.com/blog/altmba-week-2/), and [week 3](http://cobyism.com/blog/altmba-week-3/) respectively) until I gave things some time to sink in and marinate a little. As February comes to a close, now feels like a good time to circle back.

## Takeaways

In no particular order, here is my attempt to distill the major insights I’m taking away from the altMBA program into a list of concise, actionable “directives”[^1]:

- **Use goals to create momentum.** Don’t be held hostage by your goals though—it’s fine to revise and curate and adjust and change your mind along the way.

- **Make decisions rationally**, whenever we have a say. When we don’t have a say, embrace the reality that irrationality is inescapable. Don’t try and set the world straight with logic.

- **Un-frame decisions and challenge constraints** like your life depends on it. Hint: the rest of your life *does* depend on it.

- **Only say “yes” when** you know what you’re saying “no” to. Don’t get crippled by fear of missing out either. Balance these forces using a “[hell yeah, or no](https://sivers.org/hellyeah)” mentality.

- **Notice quality**, but  take the time to articulate *what makes it so*. You’ll learn something, and so will everyone else.

- **Brevity rules.** Make your point quickly, and use what’s left over to engage and connect and inspire.

- **Silence** is often the most persuasive argument you can make.

- **Look for real power structures.** Ignore reported ones. Find the right domino, push it over, and stand back.

- **Stealing creates originality.** Borrow ideas deliberately and liberally to remind people of things.

- **Take stock** of your resources, limitations, and the stories you tell both yourself and the world. Learn from what you observe, and then put it all back together in a way that benefits you.

If there’s one theme that runs through all of these insights for me though, it’s this…

### No more excuses.

I now know that I possess *all of the things I need*—tangible or otherwise—to both start *and* finish any endeavour I put my mind to. At the start of the course, I think I knew this on an intellectual level, but I wasn’t living it. I couldn’t *feel* it. Now though, I’m beginning to feel this *intuitively*, and I know it’s only going to get stronger with time and practice.

## Next: Coaching for altMBA⁴

The fourth session of the program starts tomorrow, and I’m excited to share that I’ve been invited to step into the role of coach for altMBA⁴. Witnessing the altMBA process from a completely new perspective is going to yield a whole new set of profound insights, and to say I’m grateful for this opportunity is an understatement.

This next wave of ruckus makers in altMBA⁴ are a truly incredible bunch, and I’m honoured to be able to play a part in their journey. I can’t wait to see what happens next. :smiley:

[^1]: Hat tip to [this idea by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/2do) to focus on distilling things into directives. I really like the idea of this as a general practice, and it’s something I’m going to try and do more of in the future.
