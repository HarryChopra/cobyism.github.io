# Writing prompts and ideas

Connect the dots.

Write until it’s good.

Be willing to be "not very good" at something *in order to be* good later.

The "pushers" vs. everyobne else. Pushing buttons, boundaries, problems.

The spider in the corner of the room

"Do you want the chicken or the pasta?" Airplane food, choice.

Zero to many (managers), the story of management at github-pages

"Saving state", coming to terms with *that* being impossible -> presence, mindfulness

You don’t need more tools, you need more action.

Comfort zones

You can’t think yourself happy *now*. Even if you win that war, by the time you’ve got to "happy", you lost the opportunity to be happy in the original moment. Extend that mechanism day after day, and you’ll wind up at the end of your life before you know it. And you still won’t be happy.

"Meaningfulness is a *byproduct* of engagement + commitment." Quote by Irvin D. Yalom, Love’s executioner, via Brainpickings.


Fear of making a mistake in front of an audience

4 Things I’ve learned in 4 years (of product/design?) at GitHub

The word "content" sucks

Mind follows the body, and the body follows the mind. (Art of charm)

Philosophers vs. Philosophologists (people who study philosophers)

Why doesn’t leadership extend across the front-lines to customers?

Grease the groove (Pavel Tsatsouline)

- **Don’t panic**. The way we respond to pressure, constraints, and external forces is up to us, and in almost no scenario is it helpful to choose panic and stress. Shoutout to [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic).

- **There is no shortage.** You don’t need to fear running out of ideas or things to say, you just need to learn the skill (and it is a learnable skill, which you can get better at over time) of getting out of your own way and letting abundance just… turn up.

- **Rationality is subjective.** The fact that *our* reality feels more "right" than someone else’s is a complete illusion, and it needs to be recognised as such if we are to successfully make change happen. This comes back to empathy.

- **Work with the grain.** It’s better to understand the way things work and use that to your advantage to create a change for the positive than to wish things were a certain way and spend all your energy fighting with the status quo to convince it to be otherwise.
